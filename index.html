      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an emerging documentary filmmaker who is passionate about telling
        stories centered on human rights, social justice, and the courageous
        people and communities who fight back in the face of inequity. (or
        people and communities who leave you feeling inspired)
      </p>

      <p>
        I also consider myself an adventure filmmaker - taking my camera with me
        everywhere from sandy beaches to snow capped mountains. I love hiking
        and have recently done Te Araroa - South Island, where I documented my
        (mis)adventures on the trail! I aim to tell personal and reflective
        stories that serve to catalyze change and inspire people to act.

          Women Rising (2023) is a documentary series which tells the stories of
          brave and inspiring Iranian women who are speaking up and demanding
          change for women in Iran. The first episode highlights Hanna, one of
          the key activists behind the Women Life Freedom movement in
          Wellington, New Zealand and her story of fighting back in the face of
          gender oppression.
